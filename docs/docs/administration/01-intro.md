PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is an easy to use frontend for [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) developed at the TH Mittelhessen University of Applied Sciences ([THM](https://thm.de/)) Faculty of Health ([FB GES](https://www.thm.de/ges/)).
It is based on the experience of students, teachers and staff during the covid-19 pandemic, and the raised need for a modern and flexible video conferencing system for the use case of digital class rooms, group learning and other digital meetings.


**This Frontend uses BigBlueButton and is not endorsed or certified by BigBlueButton Inc. BigBlueButton and the BigBlueButton Logo are trademarks of BigBlueButton Inc.**

## Comparison to Greenlight
The interface is similar to another open-source project [Greenlight](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight).
During the online semester 2020 many features araised that could not be solved or were hard to implement into Greenlight.
The team behind Greenlight did an amazing job, and we want to thank for their hard work!
