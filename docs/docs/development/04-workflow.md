title: Workflow
---

If you have a question, found a bug, or a feature is missing please report this by creating an issue in this repository.
In case when you have a solution for the feature or bug you can fork this repository and implement the solution in a
corresponding branch, since we are working by the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). If
everything is ok, after a review your implementation will be merged in the main branch of the repository.

## Report a bug
Before reporting a new issue, please checkout the existing open and already **closed** issues. May be there is already a
solution for your question. If there is no appropriate issue, you can open a new one. If it is only a question you may
open an empty formless issue. In case of a feature request, or a bug report you must use the corresponding template.
Please fill out everything you can so that other can understand your problem and implement a solution or give an answer
as fast as possible without any additional discussions.

## Implementation
In case if you have a solution for a bug, or you want to implement a new feature please fork this repository, create a
new branch, implement the solution by following the [Styleguide](#styleguide) and afterwards create a pull request to
this repository. Please also don't forget to update the `CHANGELOG.md` under the section `Unreleased`. After
creating a pull request fulfill the checklist in the template. Only if everything done and the PR is linked to an
existing issue, the pull request will be checked by a maintainer of this repository.

## Testing
A new development shouldn't decrease the code testing coverage. Everything in the application must be covered by
appropriate unit and feature tests, depending on the case. In case of bugfixes a test, that fails in the appropriate
case should be implemented, to make regression tests possible for further changes in the application. For the backend the
api can be tested by using feature tests and other functions just with unit tests. For more information about tests
checkout the [Laravel testing guides](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/testing).

To run the integration tests against a real BigBlueButton server you need to set the test server in
the `.env` file:
```bash
TESTING_BBB='[{"url":"https://your-bbb-server.com/bigbluebutton/","secret":"your-secret"}]'
```

### Frontend
Since the refactoring of the frontend to Vue 3 and PrimeVue, the frontend tests are still a work in progress. 
We have started adding some basic [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests, but they are currently incomplete, and code coverage is not yet implemented. 
The old Vitest tests have been removed. If you need to reference them, please check the old branches.

If you have experience with Cypress and would like to contribute, 
your help is welcome! Please feel free to create a PR.


## Submit changes
After implementing the new feature or bugfix you must create a new pull request to the original repository by using the
corresponding pull request template. If all checks by the ci passed and all tasks in the pull request done, a maintainer
of the repository will check the PR and may make some comments on your PR. If everything fixed or there were no problems
at all, then the PR will be merged into the main branch of this repository.
