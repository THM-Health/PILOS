# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support PILOS through the matrix chat and through security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.9.x   | :x: |

v2 is much simpler and more secure than v1, so we recommend that all administrators migrate to v2 as soon as possible.
