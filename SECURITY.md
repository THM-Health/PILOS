# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support PILOS through the matrix chat and through security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.9.x   | :white_check_mark: |

We are actively developing v2 and are focused on getting it ready as soon as possible to make it an even simpler and more secure solution than v1.
Once v2 is released, v1 will no longer be supported.

Therefore, we recommend that all administrators migrate to v2 soon after its release and pre-test the latest release candidate.
